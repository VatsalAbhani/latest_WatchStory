            in Dubai. It covers serial and model numbers, dial precision, Cyclops magnification,
            bracelet and case finishing, and operational indicators.

                On a genuine Rolex, the serial and model numbers are laser engraved, precise, deep, and
                perfectly aligned. They are found between the lugs or on the rehaut, the inner bezel
                ring.

                A Rolex dial is a study in perfection. Typography is balanced, spacing is uniform, and
                the crown emblem is flawlessly polished. Counterfeits often reveal blurry print, uneven
                fonts, or slightly misaligned indices.

            <h2>Understanding the Dubai Market</h2>

                Dubai's pre owned watch trade is dynamic and fast growing. With the influx of
                international buyers and sellers, counterfeits can occasionally circulate alongside
                genuine pieces.

                <strong>Checklist for Buyers</strong>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li>Request the original box and warranty card.</li>
                    <li>Verify the service history and the seller's trade license.</li>
                    <li>
                        Be wary of unusually low prices. Authentic luxury rarely depreciates dramatically
                        without clear reason.
