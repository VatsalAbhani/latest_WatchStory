      {/* Intro */}
      <p className="lead text-xl text-offwhite/80">
        For several years, the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak wasn’t just a watch – it was an economic
        event. Prices surged to unprecedented highs through 2022 and early 2023, creating one of the
        strongest hype cycles the secondary market has ever seen.
      </p>

      <p className="lead text-xl text-offwhite/80">
        Now, in late 2025, that era has cooled. Prices have corrected and stabilised, leaving many
        owners – especially in Dubai – asking a difficult question: “Did I miss the top? Is it still
        a good time to sell my AP?”
      </p>

      <p>
        As specialists who analyse Royal Oak prices every day, our answer is clearer than it seems.
        This is not a crash – it is a normalisation. And for many sellers,{" "}
        <strong>right now is still one of the most strategic times to exit</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this guide, we will walk through what has really happened to the Royal Oak market, why
        demand for the right pieces remains incredibly strong, and how to get a data-driven valuation
        for your Audemars Piguet in Dubai.

      </figure>

      <h2>The Royal Oak Market Shift: Correction, Not Collapse</h2>

      <p>
        During the hype cycle, Royal Oaks – especially references like{" "}
        <strong>15500ST</strong>, <strong>15510ST</strong>, and <strong>15202ST “Jumbo”</strong> –
        reached levels that even experienced collectors felt were unsustainable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those prices were driven by a mix of cheap money, social media hype, and global shortages.
        They were never meant to last. When conditions normalised, so did the market.
      </p>

      <p>
        The important point is this:{" "}
        <strong>
          even after the correction, many Royal Oak models still sit around 100–150% above their
          pre-2020 levels
        </strong>
        . That means:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>You are not “selling low” in historical terms.</li>
        <li>
          You are <strong>realising real gains</strong> that have built up over the last several years.
        </li>
        <li>
          The “paper high” of 2022 was never guaranteed – the price you can achieve today is what
          actually matters.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For many owners, especially those who bought before or early in the boom, selling an
        Audemars Piguet Royal Oak in 2025 still means walking away with a very strong result.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Today’s Market Is a Flight to Quality</h2>

      <p>
        The biggest change in today’s Royal Oak market isn’t demand – it is{" "}
        <strong>selectivity</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the hype, almost everything sold. Today, collectors are buying the{" "}
        <em>right</em> watches, not <em>every</em> watch. The market now heavily rewards quality,
        authenticity, and provenance.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Full Sets: Box, Papers, and Provenance</h3>

      <p>
        A Royal Oak that comes as a <strong>full set</strong> – watch, original box, warranty card,
        and manuals – commands a noticeable premium.
      </p>

      <p>
        A “naked” watch without papers can often trade{" "}
        <strong>15–20% lower</strong> than an otherwise identical piece with full documentation,
        because collectors want confidence in authenticity, history, and resale potential.
      </p>

      <figure className="my-8">
        <img
          src="/blog-imgs/ap-royal-oak-box-paper.jpg"
          alt="Full set Audemars Piguet Royal Oak with box and papers"
          className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded-md border border-border/50"
          loading="lazy"
        />
        <figcaption className="mt-2 text-sm text-offwhite/60">
          A true “full set” Royal Oak – the gold standard for collectors and the strongest resale
          position for sellers.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>2. Condition: Has It Been Polished?</h3>

      <p>
        With the Royal Oak, <strong>case geometry is everything</strong>. The sharp bevels, brushed
        surfaces, and polished facets are integral to the design.
      </p>

      <p>
        A lightly worn, unpolished 15500ST with honest surface marks is often worth more than an
        aggressively polished example where those edges have been softened. Collectors today pay close
        attention to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sharpness of the bezel and case lines</li>
        <li>Original brushing and finishing</li>
        <li>Bracelet stretch and wear</li>
        <li>Any evidence of over-polishing or case work</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. References That Still Command Heat</h3>

      <p>
        Not every Royal Oak behaves the same in the market. Some references remain extremely
        competitive, especially when they are full set and in excellent condition. These include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>15510ST</strong> (especially blue and grey dials)</li>
        <li><strong>15500ST</strong></li>
        <li><strong>15202ST “Jumbo”</strong> (discontinued, highly collected)</li>
        <li>Selected <strong>frosted</strong> and <strong>openworked</strong> references</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If your AP ticks these boxes, you are not in a weak position. You are holding a{" "}
        <strong>premium, globally liquid asset</strong> – especially in a watch hub like Dubai.
      </p>

      <h2>How WatchStory Values Your Audemars Piguet Royal Oak</h2>

      <p>
        Guessing your Royal Oak’s value from social media, old forum posts, or what a friend sold
        their watch for 18 months ago is risky. The market has moved.
      </p>

      <p>
        At WatchStory, every valuation is a{" "}
        <strong>transparent, data-driven process based on today’s market</strong>, not yesterday’s
        hype. When you submit your watch, we analyse three key pillars.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Provenance: Documentation and History</h3>

      <p>
        We start by confirming what you have: full set or watch-only, original purchase location,
        any service history, and supporting documents. This helps us validate authenticity and
        understand how attractive your watch will be to serious buyers.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Condition: More Than Just “Good” or “Excellent”</h3>

      <p>
        Our specialists inspect case, bezel, bracelet, and dial in detail. We look at:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Original finishing and edges</li>
        <li>Signs of refinishing or heavy polishing</li>
        <li>Bracelet stretch and clasp wear</li>
        <li>Crystal, dial, and hands</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A factory-sharp case with light everyday wear will usually attract a stronger offer than a
        heavily refinished watch, even if the latter “looks cleaner” at first glance.
      </p>

      <figure className="my-8">
        <img
          src="/blog-imgs/ap-movement.webp"
          alt="Watchmaker inspecting a Royal Oak movement with a loupe"
          className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded-md border border-border/50"
          loading="lazy"
        />
        <figcaption className="mt-2 text-sm text-offwhite/60">
          Every AP we value is inspected by specialists who understand how condition and originality
          affect true market price.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>3. Real-Time Market Data: Global and Dubai-Specific</h3>

      <p>
        Finally, we match your watch against <strong>current, real transactions</strong>. Our offers
        are informed by:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Recent auction results for the same reference</li>
        <li>Private dealer and collector sales</li>
        <li>Live asking and achieved prices on trusted platforms</li>
        <li>Demand and pricing trends specific to Dubai and the GCC region</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The result is a valuation that reflects what a serious buyer is willing to pay{" "}
        <em>right now</em>, not an outdated peak from 2022.
      </p>

      <h2>The Verdict: Is Now a Good Time to Sell Your AP in Dubai?</h2>

      <p>
        For many Royal Oak owners, the answer is <strong>yes</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The speculative highs are gone, but the market has stabilised at a very healthy level. Prices
        are still far above pre-2020 norms, and demand for high-quality, full-set Royal Oaks from
        trusted sellers in Dubai remains strong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Selling now is not about panic. It is about making a{" "}
        <strong>smart, data-driven decision</strong>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Lock in years of appreciation.</li>
        <li>Exit before potential further softening in weaker references.</li>
        <li>Take advantage of strong demand for top-condition pieces.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you have been thinking, “Should I sell my Audemars Piguet Royal Oak now or wait?”, the
        question to ask is not “Can it go back to the old peak?” but{" "}
        <strong>“Is the price I can achieve today a win for me?”</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Ready to See What Your AP Is Really Worth?</h2>
